Performance Comparison.
Importing Data into MongoDB and MySQL Databases.
-------------------------------------------------

1. Data Source for the Experiment
   -------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) regularly generates estimates of TB burden 
for the Global Tuberculosis Report. WHO makes this data available for download 
as comma separated value (CSV) files. The Web page at the following URL 
provides access to this data:
    http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/download/en/

You may download WHO TB burden estimates [1.1Mb] from
    https://extranet.who.int/tme/generateCSV.asp?ds=estimates

The first row in each CSV file contains variable names. You can find the 
definition of each variable in the data dictionary:
    https://extranet.who.int/tme/generateCSV.asp?ds=dictionary


2. Details of the Experiment
   --------------------------
This assignment requires you to carry out a two-part experiment.

(A)
Install the recent version of MongoDB, and import the WHO TB burden 
estimates as MongoDB documents. Measure the performance of this operation and 
record the readings across multiple runs in at least four different 
workstations.

(B)
Install the recent version of MySQL and and import the WHO TB burden 
estimates into a table. Measure the performance of this operation and record 
the readings across multiple runs in at least four different workstations.

Use the same programming language (either Python or Java) to carry out both 
(A) and (B). 


3. Drawing conclusions and Insights
   ---------------------------------
(1) What do the results obtained in this experiment suggest? Do these results
    match with your hypothesis or your views?
(2) Will the same results hold if the data size is increased by three times?
